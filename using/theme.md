# Themes

OhMySh has various themes for you.

## Getting the Theme

All the themes of OMS are installed at `$OMS_DIR/usr/theme`. Run the following command to get a list of them:

```sh
oms --themelist
```

You can also make a customized theme by yourself. Read [This page](https://github.com/ohmysh/ohmysh/blob/main/usr/theme/readme.md).

## Changing the Theme

Run the following command:

```sh
oms -t THEME-NAME
```

> `THEME-NAME` is the name of the theme you want.
